# Assignment 1: Money Change Calculator

## Overview:
This assignment requires the creation of a program that calculates the change to be returned after a purchase. The solution should be implemented as both a Console Application and a Windows Forms Application.

## Requirements:

### Input:
- The price of the item(s) (in whole kronor).
- The amount paid by the customer (in whole kronor).

### Output:
- The change to be returned, broken down by banknotes (500-, 200-, 100-, 50-, and 20-kronor) and coins (10-, 5-, 1-kronor).

### Additional Features:
- If the user has paid less than the price, the program should handle and display an appropriate message.
- The Windows Forms Application should also have a button to exit the application.

### Note:
- If a certain banknote or coin is not needed for change (i.e., the count is zero), it should not be displayed in the output.

## How to run:

### Console Application:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the .exe file for the console application.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

### Windows Forms Application:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the .exe file for the Windows Forms application.
3. Interact with the GUI to input the necessary information and get the change breakdown.
