# Assignment 3: Swedish Personal Number Validator

## Overview:
This application provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to validate Swedish personal identity numbers. It's designed as a Windows Forms Application. The primary objective is to enable users to register personal data, verify the legitimacy of personal identification numbers, and deduce gender based on specific algorithms. The interface also encompasses a menu to streamline user options.

## Requirements:

### Input:
- First name of the individual.
- Last name of the individual.
- Personal identification number.

### Output:
- Confirmation on the validity of the personal identification number.
- Determination of the individual's gender, i.e., male or female.

### Additional Features:
- The application should sport a user-friendly form interface to display results.
- Implement a menu with two options: one for registering a person and another to exit the program.
- The personal class (personklass) should be comprehensive, encapsulating the properties and methods as detailed in the assignment.
- Integration of either the '21-algorithm' or 'Kontrollsiffran' to validate personal numbers.
- The last algorithm should assist in distinguishing the gender of the person based on the personal number.

## How to run:

### Windows Forms Application:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Launch the application executable.
3. Use the form to input personal data.
4. Engage with the menu to either register a person or exit the program.
5. On registering, a confirmation regarding the personal number's correctness and gender will be displayed.
